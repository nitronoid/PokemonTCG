Added Board class/struct to hold players card piles. This was done to
seperate out cards from the player class, as the player did not ever directly 
access them. The game always requires access so it makes sense to use this structure.

Added put and take functions to all card piles

Modified the way players are stored in Game. There is now an array of two players and
two boards. No pointer is required as we can access the current player as a function of 
the current turn:    Player* player = m_players[m_currentTurn % 2];

Removed attack and end turn functions from player. The turn will be ended implicitly
at the end of the players turn function. This prevents multiple calls to attack. The turn
function now returns a pair<bool, string>, where the bool indicates whether or not to
attack and the string is the name of the attack if they do.

A Board slot no longer has an active pokemon field or a basePokemon field, instead one array is used
where the last element is the active pokemon. A stack may be used instead.

The bench class now holds the active pokemon as the first index in the now 6 length array.
It also has a helper function to access this, and also count the ammount of benched pokemon.

BoardSlot now has functions energy, and active, where energy returns a multiset of 
energy cards for easy lookup/comparisson with attack requirements. active returns a reference
to the active pokemon. detachPokemon now returns a vector of pokemon. devolvePokemon
only removes the top level pokemon.
