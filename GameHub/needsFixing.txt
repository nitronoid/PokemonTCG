game.cpp -> line 32 segfault
humanplayer.cpp -> chooseCard()
SHOULD RETURN A POINTER
CHECK IF NULLPTR AND DO THE REST IF NOT
or even change to chooseCards() return vec<Card>
or have both and first return a single ptr
deck.cpp -> takeTop() and deck.cpp -> take()
add a check for m_cards.size == 0
otherwise segfaulting
in game.cpp ask for player's decklist
either return a filename or a list of strings
and take that to construct json stuff
then copy json to player deck
maybe make a card a private instance of a public card
use private internally and only expose public to players
