# PokemonTCG

A working proto-type of the Pokemon Trading Card Game.
This project was created for a software engineering unit, with the aim of producing an API to be used for programming AI to play the game.

Please view the PTCGGuides.md for more information on how to operate the system and extend it.

Before you can play you must run the setup.sh script, this will clone all dependencies for the project. You should then build the GameHub/Core/PokemonTCG.pro with qmake and make. 
This will build the python module required to run the python card scripts, and also the main executable for the game.
