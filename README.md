# PokemonTCG, shared Repo

This is where we edit and share our files to each other.\
There are four respositories:\

1. GameHub: Jack, Renat, Eric, and Ming. 
2. BrightTide: Stacy and Moira
3. RoaringHeat: Lucien and Tom
4. ForestShadow: Philip and Jamie 

Wherever your name is you will work in that respository.\
So your partner(s) can see what you do, and at the same time you can edit it.\
There is an empty file in all of the directories just delete it.

It would be useful to communicate what you have done by logging. \
You should edit the README, there will be a section for it. Under section **LOG** you should put the date of the day you done work, your name, the work you have done and an additional message to who you are communication. 

## LOG

To add in the table you put the | symbol under the last log and the seperate each column with it.
